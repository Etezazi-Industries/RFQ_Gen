   ➤ Has be selected on the GUI.

## 🌱 Git Strategy (How We Work Together)

We follow a few simple rules when writing or changing code:

1. **Always create your own branch**  
   Don’t work directly on the main branch.

2. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
   This lets others review your changes.

3. **Write sandboxed tests** for your changes  
   These tests won’t affect the main (live) system.

4. **Only the admin will approve and make it live**
